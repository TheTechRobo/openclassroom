# openclassroom
Open the classroom, we said. Stop having it be closed.


### Current Status
Adding the layout along with SOME dynamic code. Databases, creating assignments, etc, will be coming in the future.

Once layouts are done we rewrite all current logic in Rust (Rocket+Tera) then I'll add the database stuff.

See Projects page for more details


### Colour Palette
After some deliberation I've decided on three colours (suggest others if you want):

![Grey for the background](https://img.shields.io/badge/background-grey-%235C5C5C) ![White-off (hard-off too) for the text](https://img.shields.io/badge/background-white--off-%23ECE7FF) ![Pure red as the accent](https://img.shields.io/badge/background-pure%20red-%23FF0000)

(A light mode would have grey and white swapped. This is not implemented yet. Thanks to https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMS3VwGh3HY, and https://mytechclassroom.com/colors-for-learning-environment/ for ideas.)
