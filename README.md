Open the classroom, we said. Stop having it be closed.


### Colour Palette
After some deliberation I've decided on three colours (suggest others if you want):

![Grey for the background](https://img.shields.io/badge/background-grey-%235C5C5C) ![White-off (hard-off too) for the text](https://img.shields.io/badge/text-white--off-%23ECE7FF) ![Pure red as the accent](https://img.shields.io/badge/accent-pure%20red-%23FF0000)

(A light mode would have grey and white swapped. This is not implemented yet. Thanks to https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMS3VwGh3HY, and https://mytechclassroom.com/colors-for-learning-environment/ for ideas.)
