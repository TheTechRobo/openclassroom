# openclassroom
Open the classroom, we said. Stop having it be closed.


### Current Status
Adding the layout along with SOME dynamic code. Databases, creating assignments, etc, will be coming in the future.

Once layouts are done we rewrite all current logic in Rust (Rocket+Tera) then I'll add the database stuff.

See Projects page for more details
