    DON'T BE A RAT PUBLIC LICENSE  
    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

 1. Do whatever you like with the original work, just don't be a rat.

     Being a rat includes - but is not limited to - the following instances:

	 1a. Outright copyright infringement - Don't just copy the original work/works and change the name.  
	 1b. Selling the unmodified original with no work done what-so-ever, that's REALLY being a rat.  
	 1c. Modifying the original work to contain hidden harmful content. That would make you a PROPER rat.  

 2. If you become rich through modifications, related works/services, or supporting the original work,
 share the love. Only a rat would make loads off this work and not buy the original work's 
 creator(s) a pint. At least put a link back to the original creator in an easily visible place.
 
 3. Code is provided with no warranty. Using somebody else's code and getting angry at me when it goes wrong makes 
 you a HUGE rat. Fix the problem yourself. A thoughtful person would submit the fix back or submit a [bug report](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/bugs.html).

4. If you use code, calling it your own would make you a ROYAL rat. [How to cite a repo](https://academia.stackexchange.com/questions/14010/how-do-you-cite-a-github-repository)
