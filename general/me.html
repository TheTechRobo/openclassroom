    <p class="Title">Introduction</p>
    <p class="bodyText">My name is TheRuntingMuumuu but you may also know me as Owen or TRM3909. I really enjoy doing many things including gaming, programming, tinkering with computers, building with wood, repairing computers, researching technology, learning, and much more.</p>
    <p class="Title">Names</p>
    <p class="bodyText">You might be wondering a few things such as</p>
      <ul class="bodyText bodyList">
        <li>1. Why do I have so many names</li>
        <li>2. TheRuntingMuumuu??? What kind of name is that?</li>
      </ul>
    <p class="bodyText">Well, I have the name TheRuntingMuumuu because that is my primary name, I have TRM3909 since some games think TheRuntingMuumuu is too long (and the TRM was taken so xbox suggested me TRM3909) and Owen since that was what I used when I could not use TheRuntingMuumuu before I started using TRM3909. I just used the name Owen since there are many Owens at school and it was a common name.</p>
    <p class="bodyText">For the second, I did not make the name TheRuntingMuumuu. My brother did when he was young (very young). For some reason (I don't know why) he really liked Runts and Muumuus. So, once I was playing minecraft, and I made a pub (again I don't know why, it was a long time ago) but I was looking for a name. My brother somehow came up with TheRuntingPub. Later when I was creating a new account (I don't remember which one) I needed a username. So I asked around, and my brother said TheRuntingMuumuu, and since I had no other options, I took it and it stuck.</p>
    <p class="Title">What do I do</p>
    <p class="miniTitle">Gaming</p>
    <p class="bodyText">I really enjoy playing many different video games such as <a class="textLinks" target="_blank" href="../eso/index.html">ESO</a>, Skyrim, <a class="textLinks" target="_blank" href="../minecraft/index.html">Minecraft</a>, <a class="textLinks" target="_blank" href="../cr/index.html">Clash Royale</a>, DOOM 1, and many others.</p>
    <p class="bodyText">I really enjoy playing single player games such as skyrim, and DOOM1, but I have recently started liking multiplayer ones such as ESO, and Clash Royale. I play a good amount of video games (a bit too much probably) and I enjoy playing them. I don't really have much to say about this other than I like gaming.</p>
    <p class="miniTitle">Coding</p>
    <p class="bodyText">I also really like coding, but have not been doing nearly enough. I currently know html and css, I am decent at python, and I can semi understand javascript. </p>
    <p class="bodyText">I currently have mostly been working on this website for the past 3 or so years and have been enjoying programming it. It has actually gone through 3 different main versions, the first was called <a href="../coding/OWSPortal.html" target="_blank" class="textLinks">Owens Weird Site</a>, and it was very primitive, but it was my first experience with programming, and html. I worked on that one on and off for about 2 years (mostly off), and finally about a year ago I got back into it and decided that I should make a new website. I did that mainly becauase the old one was such a mess of code (since I was learning from scratch) that it would be so hard to really do anything with it.</p>
    <p class="bodyText">I started working on the <a href="../coding/AlphaPortal.html" target="_blank" class="textLinks">Alpha version of TRMwebsite</a>, and got pretty far. I got a decent design with mobile compatability (missing on OWS) and much more information on the website. But, I ended up stopping about 6 months ago since because of the design of the site, I could only have one menubar for every section (which I could have probably made work if I really wanted to, but I wanted a new system) so I started working on the beta.</p>
    <p class="bodyText">The <a href="../index.html" target="_blank" class="textLinks">beta</a> is the part that I am currently working on, and is really good. I love the design, and it can house every one of muy sections that I have. The main thing that I don't like is that each section's designs are different, but I intend to merge them all sometime in the future. The beta has good mobile compatability, and all of the menus can be edited through one file, which is a really good thing for me.</p>
    <p class="miniTitle">Building Computers</p>
    <p class="bodyText">I really like building computers and have built mine, and I have helped 2 people build and choose the parts to their computers. I am also currently helping <a href="https://thetechrobo.github.io" target="_blank" class="textLinks">TheTechRobo</a> with building one. I have enough experience with building them and finding the right parts, but I am not excellent. I do not know much about overclocking, cooling, or many other things, but I hope to get better in the future.</p>
    <p class="miniTitle">Learning</p>
    <p class="bodyText">I really like to learn about a bunch of different things ranging from video games, to computers, to random topics I see. Now, learning is not to be confused with school. I do not like school at all. In my opinion the school system (or at least my school board) is completely broken. It works for "regular" people but anyone who is weird (or different if you want) like me, well it does not work at all. They say that they are inclusive and help everyone, but they do not. I have gotten almost no help with what I struggle with since it is not what the "average" person needs help with. If I wanted I could probably wright 15 pages on everything I dislike about my school board but I will not since it will just get me very angry. But I do really like learning about anything (especially computers) so if anyone has a topic that they think I should learn, you can contact me <a class="textLinks" href="../contact.html">here</a>.</p>
